# PlayGround
This is a playground project to test small code. 

Because I'd like to summary and note how I resolve a problem so I will make a commit everytime a small problem is tested and resolved. 
Eg: Test Webview javascript callback, test try catch depth behaviour, test standard request permission flow, etc
